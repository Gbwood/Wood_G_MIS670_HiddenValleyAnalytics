""This place is charming! The interior is beautifully decorated, with extra touches all around. The outside is peaceful and quiet, with trails to walk and enjoy the outdoors, or a screened in porch to relax and reflect."" --Tiara

""If you're looking for something local to Kansas City, yet feel so far away hidden in nature with the beautiful ambience this is your place. It was a super quiet and peaceful place that enabled us to connect and embrace everything around! It was super cozy, very spacious and inviting for all. We will definitely make this one of our must visit again places for a longer period next time."" - Michelle

""The retreat is definitely worth a visit! So much so that we already want to come back. You can't beat the coziness of the guesthouse and treehouse. Stan and Denise are lovely and put so many wonderful touches into everything. I need more than five stars to rate it!"" - -Megan",Hidden Valley Wilderness Retreat,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hiddenvalleywilderness/photos/a.1442693329097745.1073741830.1252406928126387/1729622453738163/?type=3,2018-04-25 17:49:00,51,3,14,40,10,1,0,0,0
