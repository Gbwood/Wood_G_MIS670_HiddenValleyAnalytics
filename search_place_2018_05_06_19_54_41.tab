1252406928126387	"Hidden Valley Wilderness Retreat"	"Vacation Home Rental"	660	23	21	"This peaceful property was once a priest's retreat. We purchased it in May 2016 and spent a year renovating.  Our plan was to share this special place with others. The goal is to add 3 treehouses, an outdoor pavilion and a bathhouse. Currently, we have 1 retreat suite with an attached treehouse available. The retreat suite has a fully private guest suite and an adjoining bedroom treehouse. Also, there are over 1+ miles of walking trails. Included in your guest suite are large picture windows for bringing the natural inside. The full kitchen in the retreat house comes with refrigerator, stove, microwave, tableware, and cookware. Bring your own food and beverages. The master suite has a king size bed with luxury mattress and a prayer/mediation nook; sitting area with couch, recliners and tv; and a bathroom with shower. The sunken living room has a large sectional couch and tv. The treehouse has a full size comfortable bed and sitting area. The spacious screened in porch overlooking a koi/ goldfish pond, has multiple seating options for enjoying the peaceful sounds of nature any time of the day. Covered parking is provided.  Guest Access  You will have access to covered parking, a fully private guest suite and screened in porch, and the over 1 mile of maintained trails, rocky streams, and ponds. Please exercise caution when enjoying the peaceful acreage in this rugged valley. Please stay on maintained trails and obey all signs. Trail maps are provided. This acreage is extremely secluded, quiet, and peaceful. It is nearly 100% wooded with old growth oaks, elms, and other trees. You will find yourself renewed after experiencing all the valley has to offer.  Interaction with Guests  We love to meet our guests, but your privacy and renewal time is our priority. You may see us when outdoors. As possible, we will limit maintenance activities while guests are enjoying the property.
